            In a few words it is Authentic, Real, Timeless, Creative,
            Documentary and Magical. As artistic storytellers, we capture your
            wedding day the way it is. We do not stage or direct anything as we
            truly want you to enjoy yourselves during your Big Day. We want you
            to be focused on your partner, family, and friends – enjoy the
            moment – it is your day. Trust us, the more you ignore your wedding
            photographers, the better candid photographs you get. Our goal is to
            tell a real story of your wedding day through unique and timeless
            photographs that will bring tears of happiness.

            package to tell a complete wedding day story. Getting ready,
            ceremony, portraits, reception, first dance and fun dance-floor.
