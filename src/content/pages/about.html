      <h2 class="cs-title">Eliza | 4Eyes Photography</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Eliza, my wife, my best friend, and an incredible photographer. Per what
        our friends say - the smarter and sexier part of our team. Well, I’m not
        gonna argue with that.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        I could write a hundred pages to describe Eliza as a human being.
        Hundred and a half to include her dark side as well, but I’m not gonna
        do it today. I will focus on what makes her the most amazing wife and
        ‘business partner’ in the world.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        She cares. She cares a lot. About me, our family and friends, our
        clients, and our craziest dog ever Duchess. She cares so much that we
        can book only a few destination weddings a year, as she doesn’t want to
        leave our puppy for too long… Yup, that’s her!
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Eliza never gives up. Absolutely never. Try to stop her when she pursues
        her goal. I remember her attitude back in the days when we were starting
        our photography business. In the beginning, our journey was not easy;
        Honestly, I had a few moments of doubts, but she didn’t. She didn’t give
        up. She is the reason why we have become successful as photographers.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        She also pays attention to every freaking detail. It drives me crazy
        sometimes. Who else would have cared if I had left my socks on the
        floor? Right... ? But when it comes to photography, especially the
        editing part - her obsession to details is priceless. She’s pure
        gold.<br />People love her, I love her, and you’re gonna love her too. -
        Lukas

      <p class="cs-text">
        Meet Lukas. I have been married to him for over 10 years. Oh, this
        man... He is the most adventurous person I have ever met, never afraid
        to face new challenges and speak out loud the truth... He lives his life
        in high-speed mode, with an open mind to new ideas and meeting
        interesting people. Crazy, fun, brave or ridiculous ideas? Yeap...
        always his ideas... It's never boring with Lukas.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Photography is his love and passion. Trust me ... he opens his eyes in
        the morning with his joyful face and immediately starts talking about
        photography. Here we go all day long... cameras, lenses, fantastic ideas
        for photo sessions, editing techniques, and exploring new locations for
        adventure sessions. Creativity is no stranger to him, which is precious
        when it comes to our artwork. No wonder why he became such a fantastic
        artist.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        I must admit, my personal life and our photography adventure would not
        be the same without Lukas. His cheerful personality and hard work
        perfectly contribute to our marriage and photography business. - Eliza
